## What BookSearch does
BookSeach is a full-stack (MERN) web application that allows users to easily search through Google Books API, save these articles, and view more information about the returned books. In addition, data retrieved from the API include the book's title, authors, a description, and an image of the book's cover.
Saved books are saved in a database and can be retrieved at a later time.

### Users can find the deployed page [here](https://booksearch52.herokuapp.com/).
